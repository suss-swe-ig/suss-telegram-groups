== Software Architecture

The *Service Layer* is responsible for handling interactions with the Telegram API Server. The `SingletonService` class interacts with the Telegram API Server via the `AsyncTelebot` class.

The *Business Logic Layer* consists of the `Admin` class and `User` class that provide authentication and authorization for specific commands. These two classes also execute the logic of these commands.

The *Data Persistence Layer* provides the `SingletonDatabase` class that reads and writes the underlying data store powered by the Python Shelve module.
